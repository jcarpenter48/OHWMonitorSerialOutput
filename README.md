# OHWMonitorSerialOutput
Monitored Statistics Output via serial communication with an Arduino Pro Micro

This small project was built using the awesome work of the OpenHardWareMonitorLib by the Open Hardware Monitor Team (https://openhardwaremonitor.org/)

It uses an Arduino Pro Micro and a GC6502S LCD salvaged from an old alarm clock.
